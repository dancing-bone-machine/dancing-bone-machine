Websocket Server
================

This is a [PureData](http://puredata.info) external that allows you to receive messages from another application or computer using the websockets protocol. A typical use case is to receive messages from a web browser.

Build Instructions
------------------

1. Install the latest stable version of pd-extended as described [here](http://puredata.info/downloads/pd-extended). On Windows, use the installer, not the zip file. On Ubuntu Linux, check [this](http://puredata.info/docs/faq/debian) out.

2. Install the build tools for your platform. 

    On Ubuntu Linux, do `sudo apt-get install build-essential`.

    On MacOs, you need something called "Command Line Tools For Xcode", available [here](http://developer.apple.com/downloads). You'll need to create a free developer account.

    On Windows, install [MinGW](www.mingw.org).

3. Compile and install. Using a terminal on Linux or MacOS, or the MinGW shell in Windows, do

        cd /path/to/this/directory
        make
        make install #(optional, will try to copy the compiled external to ../../bin)
