  "readme": "# Apache Ripple(tm)\n\nA browser based, platform agnostic mobile application development and testing tool.\n \n## Build Requirements\n\n* nodejs, npm\n* OSX or linux (windows is not currently supported for development)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you plan to dive into the source, be sure to check out the [HACKING](https://github.com/apache/incubator-ripple/blob/master/HACKING.md) file.\n\nTo get started, you need to setup a few things, first- run (in the project root):\n\n    ./configure\n\nThis script will pull down the needed npm packages and initialize the submodules.\n\n## Build Commands\n\n    jake\n\nThis will build ripple to the `pkg/` folder. In that folder there are various targets that can be used.\n\n    jake -T\n\nThis will describe all the available commands for building and running the tests, etc.\n\n## Running As A Chrome Extension\n\n* Go to the extension management page (chrome://chrome/extensions/) in chrome.\n* Ensure that you have selected the developer mode checkbox.\n* Click the Load Unpacked extension button.\n* Select the `pkg/chrome.extension` folder.\n\nNOTE: For development you should be fine to just build with jake and refresh your browser.\nIf you end up editing anything in the ext folder you will need to refresh the extension from the extension management page.\n\nFor more information see [doc/chrome_extension.md](https://github.com/apache/incubator-ripple/blob/master/doc/chrome_extension.md).\n\n## Running Inside Other Web Browsers\n\nRipple is (by-design) browser agnostic, and _should_ be able to run inside any web browser.\n\nIf you want to run it inside other browsers, you will need to use the `pkg/hosted` target, paired with the CLI's `emulate` command.\n\nEx (using the NPM package):\n\n    ripple emulate --path to/my/app\n\n    # or\n\n    ripple emulate --remote http://remote-site.com\n\nThen navigating to (your app's html file):\n\n    http://localhost:PORT/index.html?enableripple=true\n\n## CLI & NPM Package\n\nThere is a command line interface that can be paired with the client (UI).\n\nIt can be used for various things, such as statically hosting an application, and running a local (cross origin) XHR proxy.\n\nTo install:\n\n    npm install -g ripple-emulator\n\nThis will install a global script called `ripple`. To see usage, run:\n\n    ripple help\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe `master` branch is the latest (stable) release. The `next` branch is where all development happens.\n\nIf you like the project, and want to contribute code, please issue a pull request (on [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/incubator-ripple/pulls)) into the `next` branch.\n\nNote: You will need to submit an Apache [ICLA](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas) (Individual Contributor License Agreement) for your contribution to be accepted.\n\n## Code Guidelines\n\n* 4 spaces per editor tab.\n* `jake lint`, no new lint errors introduced.\n* All unit tests are green.\n\n## Reference Material &amp; Community\n\n* [Project Site](http://ripple.incubator.apache.org)\n",
