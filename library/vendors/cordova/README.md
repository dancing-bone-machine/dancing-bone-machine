# Apache Cordova

The Apache Cordova `cordova` command was used to create initial versions of the wrapper templates in library/dancing-bone-machine/wrapper-templates. 

You may want to run the cordova command again to add plugins to one of the templates or something else. To do so, it will probably be more practical to install it globally in your system: First, install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), then do `npm install -g cordova@3.0.0` and then `cd library/dancing-bone-machine/wrapper-templates/DancingBoneMachine && cordova <whatever-you-want-to-do>`. Be careful, though because you might overwrite manual changes that we've made to the templates.
